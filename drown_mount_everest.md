# How much water would it take drown Mt. Everest?

Let us wildly oversimplify the Earth as a perfect sphere, pretend all land is exactly at sea level, and then pour on the water until Mount Everest’s summit (8 848 m) disappears under a global bathtub.^\[1]

### 1. The rough‑and‑ready math

1. **Earth’s surface area**  
   $A = 4\pi R^2$, with $R ≈ 6\,371\text{ km}$.  
   $$
     A \;\approx\; 4\pi (6\,371)^2 
       \;\approx\; 510\times10^6\;\text{km}^2
   $$

2. **Desired flood depth**  
   $H = 8.848\text{ km}$ (Everest above “sea” level).

3. **Volume of water**  
   $$
     V = A\times H 
       \;\approx\; (510\times10^6\;\text{km}^2)\times(8.848\;\text{km})
       \;\approx\; 4.5\times10^9\;\text{km}^3
   $$
   That’s **4.5 billion cubic kilometers** of water.

### 2. Putting it in perspective

* **Current global water** (all oceans, ice caps, groundwater):  
  ~1.39 billion km³.  
* **Extra water needed**:  
  $4.5 - 1.39 ≈ 3.1$ billion km³.  
* If you could import water from Mars, you’d need roughly **three times** all the water that’s already on Earth today.

### 4. The fine print (aka “real‑world gets messy”)

* **Topography matters.** In reality, some land is below 8 848 m, some is far below sea level, some far above. You’d need slightly *less* water than our “perfect sphere” estimate, but still on the order of a few billion cubic kilometers.  
* **Water source logistics.** Even if you found a cosmic firehose, it’d need to pump at roughly $1.4×10^{14}$ m³/day for 10 million years to finish the job.  
* **Climate chaos.** Before you’re done, the oceans would boil off, the crust would fracture, and you’d have bigger problems than drowning Everest.

**Answer:** You’d need on the order of **4.5 billion km³** of extra water – roughly **three times** the volume of all water currently on Earth – to submerge Mount Everest under a perfectly flat global sea.

This assumes no existing ocean depth and ignores every other geographic complication. But hey, that’s what makes it a “What If?” thought experiment.</sub>
